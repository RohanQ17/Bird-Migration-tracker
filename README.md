## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip or conda for package management

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your bird migration data in `data/raw/`
2. Start with exploratory analysis in `notebooks/`
3. Develop reusable code in `src/migration_tracker/`
4. Run tests with `pytest tests/`

## Data Sources

Suggested data sources for bird migration analysis:
- eBird database (Cornell Lab of Ornithology)
- BirdLife International migration data
- Movebank animal tracking database
- Weather and environmental data from NOAA
- Breeding Bird Survey data
- GPS tracking data from tagged birds

## Analysis Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Scripts to gather bird migration and environmental data
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing GPS coordinates, timestamps, and species data
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Migration route visualization and seasonal patterns
4. **Feature Engineering**: Environmental variables, distance calculations, timing metrics
5. **Modeling**: Migration route prediction, timing analysis, and species behavior models
6. **Visualization**: Interactive maps, migration corridors, and seasonal dashboards
