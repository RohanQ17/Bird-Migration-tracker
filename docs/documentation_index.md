## üöÄ Quick Navigation

### I'm New to the Project
1. Start with [Workflow Guide](workflow_guide.md) - Get up and running quickly
2. Review [Project Architecture](project_architecture.md) - Understand the big picture
3. Dive into [Technical Approach](technical_approach.md) - When you're ready to modify code

### I Want to Use the Project
- **Quick Demo**: Follow the "Quick Start Workflow" in [Workflow Guide](workflow_guide.md)
- **Full Analysis**: Use the "Deep Dive Workflow" in [Workflow Guide](workflow_guide.md)
- **Real Data**: See "Production Workflow" in [Workflow Guide](workflow_guide.md)

### I Want to Understand the Code
- **Architecture Overview**: Read [Project Architecture](project_architecture.md)
- **Code Details**: Study [Technical Approach](technical_approach.md)
- **Design Rationale**: Both architecture and technical docs explain "why" decisions were made

### I Want to Extend the Project
- **Understanding the Foundation**: [Project Architecture](project_architecture.md)
- **Adding Features**: "Extending the System" section in [Technical Approach](technical_approach.md)
- **Best Practices**: "Development Philosophy" in [Project Architecture](project_architecture.md)

## üéØ Key Concepts Explained

### Data Science Architecture
The project uses a **modular pipeline architecture** that separates:
- **Data Layer**: Loading and preprocessing
- **Analysis Layer**: Statistical analysis and insights
- **Visualization Layer**: Charts and dashboards  
- **Export Layer**: Reports and file outputs

### Jupyter Notebooks Role
Notebooks serve multiple purposes:
- **Interactive exploration**: Try ideas quickly
- **Documentation**: Tell the story of your analysis
- **Integration testing**: Verify all components work together
- **Presentation**: Share insights with stakeholders

### Configuration-Driven Design
Settings live in YAML files, not code:
- Easy to modify behavior without programming
- Different configurations for different scenarios
- Non-programmers can adjust parameters

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### For Data Scientists
1. **Explore** in Jupyter notebooks
2. **Extract** reusable code to Python modules
3. **Document** your process in markdown cells
4. **Test** your functions with sample data

### For Software Developers
1. **Review** the architecture documentation
2. **Understand** the data science workflow
3. **Follow** existing patterns when adding features
4. **Test** both individual components and full pipeline

## üìã Document Maintenance

These documents are living guides that should be updated when:
- New features are added to the system
- Architecture patterns change
- Workflows are modified or improved
- New best practices are discovered

## ü§ù Contributing to Documentation

When adding new features:
1. **Update the relevant technical documentation**
2. **Add workflow steps if user-facing**
3. **Explain architectural decisions in context**
4. **Include examples and troubleshooting tips**
